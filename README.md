We hope that the contents herein provide value to our users, as well as to support, ops teams, etc. If you find any information lacking, unclear, or just flatout wrong, you would be doing us a tremendous service if you were to open an [issue here](https://github.com/Enterprise-connect/documentation/issues) to help us find it and correct it. Thank you in advance for your contribution to this ever-evolving project!

## "What happened to the setup guide?"
Previously, you were able to find an [EC Setup Guide](https://enterprise-connect.github.io/documentation/ec-guide) here. Well, it's still here. While we rearrange this repo to be easier to navigate, more accurate, more consistent, and more VISUAL - we will continue to provide the old end-to-end setup guide. However, that guide is 'deprecated', for all intents and purposes, and will not be updated and maintained any longer.
