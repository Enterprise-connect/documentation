### "What happened to the setup guide?"
It was too long and not being utilized. Everything that was in the old guide is here, only updated for accuracy, and with a more modular layout. If you can't find something in this guide that you think was in the old guide, you would be doing us a generous service if you were to open an [issue here](https://github.com/Enterprise-connect/documentation/issues) to help us update it.
